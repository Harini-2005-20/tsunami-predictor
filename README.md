# ðŸŒŠ Tsunami Predictor Project

This project uses machine learning and real-world tsunami data to:

1. Predict the **likelihood** of a tsunami occurring after an earthquake
2. Estimate the **severity** (wave height) if a tsunami occurs

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- NOAA Tsunami Events
- USGS Earthquake Data

## ðŸš€ Future Goals
- Add geographic visualizations
- Improve model with time-based trends
- Deploy as a dashboard/web app
